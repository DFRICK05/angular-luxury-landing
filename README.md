![Preview]<img width="1894" height="977" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b14cac-830a-4f4b-98fe-396a749c0a41" />

Just finished building this luxury real estate landing page to practice modern frontend techniques. The goal was to create a "premium" feel using smooth scroll and cinematic animations without relying on heavy libraries.

**Focus for today:** Glassmorphism, Scroll-driven animations, and Angular Standalone Components.

## What I Learned / Implemented 🚀

- **Cinematic Animations**: Used `anime.js` to create staggered entrance animations for text and images.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated `Lenis` for that buttery smooth scroll effect (essential for luxury vibes).
- **Interactive UI**:
  - **Sticky Sections**: Created a dynamic background change effect on scroll.
  - **Video Modals**: Added custom video players for property tours.
- **Modern Angular**: Built entirely with Standalone Components (no NgModules!).

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Framework**: Angular 18+ (Standalone)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Motion**: Anime.js + Lenis Scroll
- **Build**: Vite

## How to Run It 🏃‍♂️

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DFRICK05/angular-luxury-landing.git
    cd angular-luxury-landing
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Start the vibe**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
